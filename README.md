# Set Fixed SL and TP 

Set Fixed SL and TP is a custom MetaTrader script that sets stop-loss and take-profit to a fixed distance in points from the selected price. It was coded by EarnForex.com for MT4 and MT5.

Its main purpose is to provide a quick way to set SL and TP on multiple positions while implementing filters to control which positions and orders to work with.
